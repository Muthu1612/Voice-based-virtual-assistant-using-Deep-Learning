# Voice-based-virtual-assistant-using-Deep-Learning
SUMMARY:
This work proposes the application of Deep learning algorithms with Natural language processing, in order to improve the learning process. This work presents design and develops architecture to provide an interactive user interface as well as a modular cognitive agent architecture for instructional question answering that includes social interaction and is tailored to a knowledge domain of a particular business. This system was designed as a personal assistant to assist consumers in resolving issues and questions about the company's products. Its implementation includes the training of Deep learning and machine learning models like Long short-term memory (LSTM), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Natural language understanding algorithms and techniques like IBM Tone analyzer and Sentiment analysis in order for the assistant to have human - like interactions. Evaluation and applications in the voice assistant is done by experiment to show how it facilitates interactive semantic data towards real time application scenarios.
